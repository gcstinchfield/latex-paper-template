# LaTex template for journal article drafts

Using git for version control in LaTex is super useful - but having to start from scratch each time is not. 

## Description

Fork / branch to start from a super simple base case to build out journal articles that can be tracked in Git & integrated with OverLeaf thanks to their GitHub plugin.
